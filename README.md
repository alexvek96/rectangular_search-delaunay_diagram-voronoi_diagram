# rectangular_search-delaunay_diagram-voronoi_diagram
2nd/2 Assignment of the "Computational Geometry" course (Spring Semester 2023 - NKUA). Python implementations to find 2D points (if any) that lie in a given rectangular area (1), the Delaunay diagram of N-points in 2D (2) and the Voronoi diagram of N-points in 2D (3). 

## files
1) "Computational Assignment 2".pdf contains the objectives of the exercise (Spring Semester 2023)
2) files and functionalities:
   * geometrical_rectangular_search_2D_no_live_plotting.py -> 
Algorithm that executes a rectangular search of 2D points, using KD-tree logic.
     
   * Delaunay_&_Voronoi_2D_no_live_plotting.py -> 
Code that finds the Delaunay and Voronoi diagrams of N-points in 2D and plotting the results on the same frame to compare the duality
of the 2 problems.

## how to execute
Run each Python file and see the results. Code comments explain anything you need to understand the code. Keep in mind that in some
executions you may have interaction with the terminal, by inputing some data for the code to run.
